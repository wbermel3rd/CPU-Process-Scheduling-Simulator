This program simulates a CPU's process scheduler through a text input system.

Instructions to run code:

- Download all .java files
- Open them in an editor or IDE
- Press run
- The program will prompt the user to input a file path of filetype CSV. The CSV file should 
  contain a process number and then the required runtime for that process.
- After inputting a CSV filepath, the user is prompted to enter a time quantum for
  the round robin algorithm.
- The program then runs through the scheduling simulator using the round robin algorithm
  with the inputted time quantum, and prints a series of analytics both at the end of each 
  round, and at the end when all processes have been completed.  

Full design and implementation by William Bermel III.
Made for NYIT's Operating Systems class in Spring 2023.
